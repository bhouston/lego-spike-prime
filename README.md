# Experiments with Lego Spike Prime Python Scripts

## Rotate to Yaw

I wrote a rotate to a specific yaw.  I do not reset the global yaw during the session so that this remains a 
static reference point.

I adjust speed dynamically as I come to the end.  I should probably also slowly speed up the motor.

## Move Distance

Move a specific distance in centimeters.  This is done via knowing the wheel circumference.
